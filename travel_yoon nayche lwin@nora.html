		<p><font size="4">In 2018 December, I went to Pyin Oo Lwin and Mandalay with my family and one of my aunts. My aunt lived in Mandalay so we went there first and then set off to Pyin Oo Lwin together. Pyin Oo Lwin or Pyin U Lwin, previously and informally known as Maymyo, is a picturesque hill town in Myanmar's Mandalay Region, approximately 67 kilometers east of Mandalay. What is special about Pyin Oo Lwin is that it has lots of magnificent waterfalls and caves. We went to many places such as the Mandalay Palace, ShweNanDaw Monastery, Kuthodaw Pagoda and many more in Mandalay and places like National Kandawgyi Gardens, Pwe Kauk Waterfall, Nan Myint Tower, and Dat Taw Gyaint Waterfall in Pyin Oo Lwin. </font></p>

		<p><font size="4"> Bagan is an ancient city and UNESCO World Heritage Site in Myanmar's Mandalay Region. From the ninth to the thirteenth century, the city served as the capital of the Bagan Kingdom, the first kingdom to unite the provinces that would later become Myanmar. Bagan is famous for its thousands of temples that were built from the 9th to 11th centuries. I visited Bagan in October holidays in 2019 and this was the last trip I went to before Covid started. This would be my favourite trip because I have always wanted to visit Bagan due to its beautiful scenery, history and culture. I went to a lot famous pagodas, tried various traditional foods, learnt more about our history and took lots of pictures. My favourite part was watching the sunset on a hill and since then, I became crazy about sunsets. </font></p>
